## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color (Light Mode): White (#FFFFFF) for a clean, modern aesthetic.
- Primary color (Dark Mode): Black (#121212) for a modern aesthetic.
- Background color (Light Mode): Very light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide subtle contrast.
- Background color (Dark Mode): Dark gray (#1E1E1E) to provide subtle contrast.
- Accent color (Light & Dark Mode): Dark gray (#333333) to provide strong visual anchors and CTAs.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Simple, monochrome icons to match the clean aesthetic. Use icons to enhance the contact and footer sections.
- Full-width sections with a maximum content width of 1200px. Use a 12-column grid layout to maintain consistency.
- Smooth, subtle animations, avoiding jarring effects. Aim for 60fps for a fluid user experience. Use transitions and transforms for a 'smooth' design.
